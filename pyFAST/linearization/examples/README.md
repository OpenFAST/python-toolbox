This directory contains different working examples to work with the linearization package.


- `postproLin_OneLinFile_NoRotation.py`: Standalone script to post-process one linearization file from OpenFAST. 
- `postproLin_MultiLinFile_Campbell.py`: Script to to post-process several linearization files generated by different OpenFAST simulations.
- `runLinTurbine.py`: (advanced) Example to run a set of OpenFAST simulations with linearizations. Requires an OpenFAST exe.
- `runCampbell.py`: Generates a Campbell diagram; write OpenFAST input files, run openfast, postprocess the linearization files, and generate the Campbell diagram plot. Requires an openfast executable.
