This folder contains examples of OpenFAST postprocessing:

- RadialInterp: interpolate a timeseries to a given radial location based on OpenFAST radial node outputs.
- RadialPostPro: extract average OpenFAST outputs as function of the radial coordinates
- Remap: remap a dataframe: change names, and perform operations (e.g. change units, scale, combine signals)
